# La Belle Dame Sans Merci
## By John Keats

1.  :ghost:

    Ah, what can ail thee, wretched wight,
    Alone and palely loitering?
    The sedge is withered from the lake,
    And no birds sing. 

2.  :squirrel:

    Ah, what can ail thee, wretched wight,
    So haggard and so woe-begone
    The squirrel's granary is full, 
    And the harvest's done.

3.  :white_flower:

    I see a lily on thy brow
    With anguish moist and fever dew,
    And on thy cheek a fading rose
    Fast withereth too.

4.  :angel:

    I met a lady in the meads,
    Full beautiful, a faery's child:
    Her hair was long, her foot was ligh,
    And her eyes were wild.

5.  :horse:

    I set her on my pacing steed,
    And nothing else saw all day long;
    For sideways would she lean, and sing
    A faery's song.

6.  :couple:

    I made a garland for her head,
    And bracelets too, and fragrant zone;
    She looked at me as she did love,
    And made sweet moan.

7.  :couple_with_heart:

    She found me roots of relish sweet,
    And honey wild, and manna dew,
    And sure in language strange she said,
    "I love thee true!"

8.  :no_good:

    She took me to her elfin grot,
    And there she gazed and sighed deep,
    And there I shut her wild, sad eyes
    So kissed to sleep.

9.  :sleeping:

    And there we slumbered on the moss,
    And there I dreamed, ah! woe betide,
    The latest dream I ever dreamed
    On the cold hill side.

10.  :fearful:

    I saw pale kings, and princes too,
    Pale warriors, death-pale were they all;
    Who cried "La belle Dame sans merci
    Hath thee in thrall!"

11.  :disappointed_relieved:

    I saw their starved lips in the gloam,
    With horrid warning gaped wide,
    And I awoke and found me here,
    On the cold hill side.

12.  :ghost:

    And that is why I sojourn here,
    Alone and palely loitering,
    Though the sedge is withered from the lake,
    And no birds sing.
